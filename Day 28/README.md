# Day 28

Today we will learn to clear the stash.

## Problem Statement:

If you want to inspect your stash stack, use the command <br>
`git stash list`

Oh, you don't want to keep your stashed changes? There are way too many? Then go ahead and clear the stack with <br>
`git stash clear`

If you only want to discard a certain stash entry, you can use <br>
`git stash drop < stash>`

Clear your stash stack!
