# Day 1

This file is created in order to help me understand this platform.

Steps:
 - Create a simple file like a README or a text file.
 - Write something inside the file and save it.

Follow the steps to make the first commit:

1. Add the file using git.
```bash
git add 'file-name.txt'
```

2. Give a commit message in order to remember.
```bash
git commit -m "message in a bottle"
```

3. Push that item within the branch (here its **main**).
```bash
git push -u origin main
```

Congratualations, you made your first commit!! ðŸŽ‰
